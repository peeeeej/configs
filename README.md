once you have cloned the repo, run ./configs.sh in your terminal. if you're configuring a new mac, run ./preferences.sh and ./apps.sh. run the code-extensions.sh script last (see script for link to doc).

WARNING: RUNNING THE CONFIGS.SH SCRIPT WILL REMOVE .bashrc, .bash_profile, .zshrc AND .vimrc FROM YOUR HOME FOLDER WITHOUT WARNING!
THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING
