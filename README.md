once you have cloned the repo, run ./configs.sh in your terminal. if you're configuring a new mac, run ./apps.sh and ./preferences.sh (note: in that order, preferably. they're separate so you can opt-in as you go, however, vs running in a singular file). run the code-extensions.sh script last (see script for link to doc).

WARNING: RUNNING THE CONFIGS.SH SCRIPT WILL REMOVE .bashrc, .bash_profile, .zshrc AND .vimrc FROM YOUR HOME FOLDER WITHOUT WARNING!
THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING
